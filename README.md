# Classification of gamma particles in the atmosphere.

The air in our atmosphere is filled with many particles, even when it appears to be clear.The data are generated to simulate the registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The goal is to classify gamma particles using a tpot classifier, logistic regression, and Random Forest. Based on data downloaded from Kaggle about the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset.
